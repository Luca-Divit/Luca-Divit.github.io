        <p>I have always had a natural curiosity about how things work, which sparked my interest in coding. The endless possibilities and opportunities for creativity in this field have captivated me. Currently, I work as a freelance developer, offering my services in both front-end and back-end development. Additionally, I have the privilege of teaching coding at BCS Tech 10 accredited Le Wagon coding bootcamp in London.</p>
